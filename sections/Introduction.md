#About
##Philosophy
Simple War is intended to be a more simulationist interpretation of futuristic war games. The game bases its resolution mechanics around the average human soldier, with the goal of allowing for massive aliens and advanced technologies to feel truly devastating while still being vulnerable to heroic pluckiness and the occasional inhaled hand grenade. 

Simple War is a modular system built to provide players meaningful strategic and tactical options. Army management at the strategic level involves simultaneous decisions made by both players. Tactical encounters are built around the combat resolution system, allowing the individual strengths of the units involved to shine through.

The core mechanics and faction rules will always be digital and free. Simple War is intended for play with any suitable token representations for playersâ€™ armies and will never be tied to any specific requirements beyond those one might reasonably expect an opponent to be concerned with (such as approximate model profile for measuring ranges and fitting on tables). 

Specific mission packs or add-on rules may one day be available; there may be a patreon of some sort set up for monetization, though sharing will be encouraged.

##Comparisons
Though aesthetically influenced by popular sci-fi war games like 40K and Infinity, the army management and gameplay resolution mechanics are better compared to older war games, especially early software-based space games. 

##Structure
The rules are laid out to provide both a swift introduction to playing and a comprehensive understanding of the minutiae involved. However, there are still a not-inconsiderable number of core concepts and rules that need to be touched upon before players can begin a game of Simple War. These will be presented from a top-down perspective to provide a guided approach, and then explored more thoroughly in dedicated sections with specific instructions.

If you have read the core rules for a game like Warhammer, you will be familiar with the structure of the rules presentation.
